Once you've completed [setup](..), you can get started adding [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) content by creating a `content` directory:

```bash
mkdir content
```

Then you can add a docs folder. You can name that folder anything you like, for example `docs` or `documentation` (or something in a different language!). For this guide, we'll call it `docs`:

```bash
mkdir content/docs
```

Now, create a docs landing page
