Tract was built from the ground up with support for internationalization (aka **i18n**) (as many languages as you'd like).

## How i18n works in Tract

In Tract, each translation of your docs is essentially its own site with its own search index. The one exception to this is the language switcher dropdown that appears in the navbar in *all* translations (you can see it up above as **English** with a little globe next to it).
