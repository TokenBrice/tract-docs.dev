Welcome to **Tract**, a theme for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator. Tract is designed for large, multi-faceted, and potentially multi-lingual documentation projects. It includes a variety of [features](#features)

Tract is currently at version **{{< version >}}**. This very early release is intended mostly for me to garner feedback from tech writers and to get a sense for how people might use it.

## Features

{{< warning title="Limitations" >}}
Tract has some known limitations at this time that it's worth being aware of:

* In general, the aesthetic is getting there but still a work in progress. Later versions of the theme will have a similar aesthetic *spirit* but many components will end up looking quite different.
* Mobile support is decent but not great. There are some UI bugs that I intend to iron out soon.
* No support for content [taxonomies](https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/) like tags or categories.
* Only one available documentation layout (the dashboard layout that you can see in action [here](/en/docs))
