Tract is a theme for the amazing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator that's geared toward large-scale documentation projects. The theme is currently at version **{{< version >}}**.

## Features

* **Search**. Tract has built-in search powered by a statically generated JSON search index. You can see the current index [here](/en/index.json).

* **[Internationalization](/en/docs/i18n) support**. Each translation of your docs is a self-contained universe with its own search index. Hover over **ðŸŒŽ English** in the navbar to see this in action.

* **[Customization](/en/docs/getting-started/adjust-the-aesthetic)**. Change the color scheme and font of your Tract project with just one line 

## Current limitations

Tract is only at version {{< version >}} and thus in its very early stages. These early releases are intended largely to garner community input ([issues](https://github.com/tract-docs/tract/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/tract-docs/tract/pulls) welcome!), so there are some known limitations that will be addressed in the future:

* **Not-so-great mobile support**. Some things look good and work well on mobile, others don't. For now, you should consider Tract desktop only.

* **Limited taxonomy support**. There is currently support for page tags, but it's limited.

* **Rough aesthetic**. My goal is to make Tract docs arrestingly beautiful to look at. At the level of [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs), [Algolia](https://algolia.com/doc), [Zeit](https://zeit.co/docs) and others. It looks okay now but what you're seeing is *not* the finished aesthetic.

* **Limited feature set**. Over time, I have a long list of features I'd like to add, such as copy/pastable code snippets, beautiful timelines and changelogs, auto-generated download pages, and much more. For now the theme is fairly minimal.
